			<p>Hi, my name is Thrisha. I was born and raised in New York City. I graduated from the University of New York with a degree in Business Administration. After graduation, I worked for a marketing agency for three years before starting my own business.</p>
			<p>My business specializes in social media marketing for small businesses. We help our clients build their online presence and increase their sales through targeted marketing campaigns. I'm proud of the work we've done and the impact we've made in our community.</p>
			<p>When I'm not working, I enjoy hiking, playing basketball, and spending time with my family and friends. I believe in living a balanced life and making time for the things that matter most.</p>
